                <p class="about"><em>Swami Vivekananda’s (1863 – 1902) vast knowledge of Eastern and Western culture, deep
                    spiritual
                    insight, brilliant conversation, broad human sympathy, and colourful personality are presented in
                    this engrossing biography. Swami Vivekananda, India’s first spiritual and cultural ambassador to the
                    West, preached Vedanta’s universal message: the Godhead’s non-duality, the soul’s divinity, the
                    oneness of existence, and religious harmony. Swami Vivekananda born Narendranath Datta was an Indian
                    Hindu monk, philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the
                    chief disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna. He was a key figure in the introduction of
                    Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world and is credited with raising interfaith awareness,
                    and bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion. Vivekananda became a popular
                    figure after the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago, where he began his famous speech with the
                    words, "Sisters and brothers of America...," before introducing Hinduism to Americans. He
                    was so impactful at the Parliament that an American newspaper described him as "an orator by divine
                    right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the Parliament". After great success at the
                    Parliament, in the subsequent years, Vivekananda delivered hundreds of lectures across the United
                    States, England and Europe, disseminating the core tenets of Hindu philosophy, and founded the
                    Vedanta Society of New York and the Vedanta Society of San Francisco (now Vedanta Society of
                    Northern California), both of which became the foundations for Vedanta Societies in the West.
                    Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined from a young
                    age towards religion and spirituality. He later found his guru, Ramakrishna, and became a monk.
                    After the death of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda extensively toured the Indian subcontinent, acquiring
                    first-hand knowledge of the living conditions of Indian people in then British India. Moved by their
                    plight, he resolved to help his countrymen, and found a way to travel to the United States where he
                    was highly successful. In India, Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math, which provides spiritual
                    training for monastics and householder devotees, and the Ramakrishna Mission, to provide charity,
                    social work and education. Vivekananda was also a major force in contemporary Hindu reform
                    movements, and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India. He is regarded as a
                    patriotic saint, and his birthday in India is celebrated as National Youth Day
